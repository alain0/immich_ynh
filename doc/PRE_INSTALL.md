As the pyhton version shipped in Debian stable is not always supported, a recent version could be built during the installation process. It may take a while to achieve that (15 to 60 minutes).

This package provides support for the JPEG, PNG, WebP, AVIF (limited to 8-bit depth), TIFF, GIF and SVG (input) image formats.
**HEIC/HEIF file format is not supported** (see cf. https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/immich_ynh/issues/40#issuecomment-2096788600).

Please ensure **your mobile app and server are on the same version**. Otherwise, you won't be able to access the app.
